# Circuit live simulator

## Made by Joel Rosehill

### This is a circuit simulator that will simulate component logic like transistor logic and other complex things.
### This simulator wont look at how much power is consumed or other things like that, no, this will be pure logic for advanced structure making and testing in real time.
